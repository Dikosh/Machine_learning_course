    "## Linear regression\n",
    "Lm tends to establish a relationshiop between dependent and independent variable by fitting the best fit of the straight line. There are two types of linear regression- **Simple and Multiple**.\n",
    "Y = wx+b\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression is useful for finding relationship between two continuous variables. One is predictor or independent variable and other is response or dependent variable. It looks for statistical relationship but not deterministic relationship. Relationship between two variables is said to be **deterministic** if one variable can be accurately expressed by the other. For example, using temperature in degree Celsius it is possible to accurately predict Fahrenheit. **Statistical** relationship is not accurate in determining relationship between two variables. For example, relationship between height and weight. We use **Multiple linear regression** when have multiple dependent variables and one independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "`The core idea is to obtain a line that best fits the data. The best fit line is the one for which total prediction error (all data points) are as small as possible. Error is the distance between the point to the regression line.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on to the algorithm, letâ€™s have a look at two important concepts you must know to better understand linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "is Cost function and Gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost function**\n",
    "The cost function helps us to figure out the best possible values  which would provide the best fit line for the data points. Since we want the best values of weights, we convert this search problem into a minimization problem where we would like to minimize the error between the predicted value and the actual value. Usually we use MSE as cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient descent**\n",
    "The next important concept needed to understand linear regression is gradient descent. Gradient descent is a method of updating weights to reduce the cost function(MSE). The idea is that we start with some values fweights and then we change these values iteratively to reduce the cost. Gradient descent helps us on how to change the values. We must also now some traps, for example convex and non-convex distributions. Sometimes the cost function can be a non-convex function where you could settle at a local minima but for linear regression, it is always a convex function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditions to use linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "And also there is some tips and techniques about where and how you can use linear regression, but now lets just glimpse at the main conditions where your linear model will show you good results)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correlation between independent variable and dependent variables\n",
    "2. Exclude of heteredoscaticity (sorry if i write hetero******** with errors)\n",
    "3. Existence of homodescadisity\n",
    "4. Absence of multicollinearity\n",
    "5. etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "for the beginning these 4 rules is enough for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's go on! and talk about Metrics for model evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is a stastical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as **coefficient of determination**, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of R-squared is the percentage of the respone variable variation that is explained by a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared = Explained Variation / Total Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared always between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean and 1 indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "the problem of R-squared is how many junk independent variables or important independent variable or impactful independent variable you add to your model, the R-squared valie will always increase. It will never decrease with the addition of a newly independent variable, whether it could be an impactful, non-impactful, or bad variable. so we need another way to measure equivalent R-square, which is penalizes our model with any junk independent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we calculate **Adjusted R-square** with a better adjustment in the formula of generic R-square\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets try to understand formula\n",
    "\n",
    "for better understanding, lets look at the example:\n",
    "here by we have **weights of mouses and their number of id**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](pics/1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**First** thing we should do is to calculate mean of their weights, and plot it as a line in our graphic. Then we can calculate  variation of the  data around this mean as the sum of squared differences of the weight of each mouse) we call it **Regression sum of squares (SSR)**\n",
    "This gives information about how far estimated regression line is from the horizontal â€˜no relationshipâ€™ line (average of actual output).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](pics/2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "now what if instead of ordering these mice  by their ID we ordered them by their size? \n",
    "![](pics/3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "now to fit the weight for another mice we just should plot a line, now we can predict the weight with our line, you tell me about bis sized mouse, good, i will look at my line and will predict the weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**now here is a question,**\n",
    "![](pics/4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "by eye, its look like that blue line fits better than mean, now **how do we quantify that difference**? Yes you a right, we use **R-squared**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`R^2 = (Var(Mean)-Var(Line))/Var(mean)`\n",
